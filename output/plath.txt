A poem inspired by the style, structure, and vocabulary of Sylvia Plath:

of the gipsy by the peaceableness
by A consistency for the
history for the green at a

the day out A water Out The
time of a possess between A
confront for the history of

like a hand If A country in
The fire at a head on those body
So A pupil through the eye at

in the love For a sink of The
face by ampere bystanding in
A sound of The mouthpiece As the

a way about an tag Of The
inland Am The ate as The sea
off this center though an name by

attention in those panzerman
from the endowment At That head
by an moon of this eye of An

this body of angstrom hole
at a way in the fire Out a
boy like the time of the wound between

the devil from this body between
The hole in the cauldron from
a ancestress on the day of

name of this night arsenic this
arouse like the paper in an
feathery in the twelve of A

off the cauldron with a close In
a way Of a pack in the water
like a cake in a hearing For

the moon so these spot for this name
out the time Am the barb In The
brute In A name of the gipsy

if a cleft through a home for The
nothing if This dozen of A
dissolve of the sort by nobelium

devil Indiana a year For
the green of The salt before the
rack in the gift If a breath of

grave pillow All pillow like That
glitter for Every place of
the sea of The glitter in the

the case in a Pour of the bare
in the endowment with That nothing
of some ate with that nothing through
