A poem inspired by the style, structure, and vocabulary of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:

in a deck from this beauty that
the crank in the fogbell from a
ocean of a mountain for the
cable at that prevail of a
calm of a helm along the man

that presence with those today as
the sea that the keelson in the
man in the elm with each counterpart
with the i as the house that the
look of the heir as a thee of the

the rock with these skipper for the
chance in the beautiful beneath
the foot from the ship like all soul
with the face as the ho on the
dovelike through the tombstone like

doubt of the toil in that i through
the 't of a painter from the
wanderer with a daughter of
a sail on the tall upon the
swart on the till like some shout throughout

the thought from a wind of those one
of a man in the face at a
seaman of a staunch if the billow
in the ocean in the wonderful
as the calm in all fortunate

within the labor from the sleet
on the gale round an fear along
a ocean like the hair from the
sunshine round the feeling at the
joy of a upon of a life

father at the inscription on
the thee at the daughter from the d√ºrer
that the pilot of the sun in
the sail in the fairer by the
age in the nothing of the man

man for that fiery of the pavement
behind the ah on the window
from the quaint of a tonight with
the climate o'er the toil of
the form as that sunless like this

sorrow at a thee of a sun in
the master in the summer of
that sea with the i throughout the
beauty on the joy by each doubt
from the oak of the town above

an sun beside the inscription
from a song with some spirit from
all spell on the lawrence of the
compass like the flight on those billow
of a poet of a toiling as

a church against the world for the
mechanic as the i for a
rain of the day of the ship as
the sleet like a barge of the master
of the arrow above a sea

in the i within the humanity
beside this dark from the tempest
with a castle if the night like
the soul that the head through a sail
in the rope of the heart of the

on that brace of the arrow on
the doubt as the perfect on an
sail around that form of the sunless
with all storm of the tempest on
the eye at the city of the

a smoke in that brave from an spite
in the salt with the form o'er
some garland of the thing of a
thing of a want from the sail as
all vessel from some i from the
