A poem inspired by the style, structure, and vocabulary of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:

Like the level of the form From
the tenderness for the barge On
the tempest on that ocean from
all ale of an eye As A cheek
by The stress behind each church from

man With The poise of the courtyard
of a birdcall of the curve As
those window Of the 'T of That
artist upon the ship of the
form With a Forth In the thrice as

crevice beyond the feeling With
a month from the fear As The lover
Round a sang of the sound in the
lantern on the vessel from The
reef with vitamin_A man at

man Like the wind at the sleet with
a hewn in The shrouds of all beam

from the iron on the forth in

bridegroom in That death along
another level beyond each

With the dovelike on the mechanic
about Those upland from the skipper

pewter like all Broad by the Christ
With the age at The wave With the
Colder As the Christ in a mountain
through this nothing in the ghost if

of the flag in the thriceprayed
Of the song with the dovelike
of the hand in Those picture at
the sound from the castle from the
